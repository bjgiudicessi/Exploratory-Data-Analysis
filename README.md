Exploratory Data Analysis


This is my repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis".There are 8 files for the Week 1 project, 4 png pictures and 4 scripts to create each.

To run this script you need to to the following:

Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to some directory;
Download the data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip.
Unzip the data and run the scripts
